Su teoría es que muchos artistas del género urbano chileno, con sus habilidades únicas y su disciplina, podrían destacarse también en el deporte. Con este sistema, Jere espera no solo abrir nuevas oportunidades para sus colegas artistas, sino también demostrar la amplia gama de talentos que pueden ofrecer."
